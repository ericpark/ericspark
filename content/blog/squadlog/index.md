### iOS and Android apps developed using Flutter.

[SquadLog](http://www.squadlopapp.com/) is a shared space to hold yourself and friends accountable to a healthy and balanced lifestyle. The app makes it easy for you to log your daily exercise, meals, and what you 'passed up' so that it fits into your daily routine while also providing the accountability you need to achieve your goals.
